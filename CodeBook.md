Description of the Experiement Generating the Data - 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six 
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on 
the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a 
constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width 
sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and 
body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational 
force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, 
a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more 
details.

Description of the Data 
- Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
- Abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily 
living (ADL) - while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix ‘t’ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. and the acceleration signal 
was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) – both using a low pass 
Butterworth filter.

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using 
the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). A Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, 
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the ‘f’ to indicate frequency domain signals).

Description of abbreviations of measurements 
- leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements 
- Body = related to body movement 
- Gravity = acceleration of gravity 
- Acc = accelerometer measurement 
- Gyro = gyroscopic measurements 
- Jerk = sudden movement acceleration 
- Mag = magnitude of movement 
- mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements 
- The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks

The signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
•‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

•They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.
- tBodyAcc-XYZ
- tGravityAcc-XYZ
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- tBodyGyro-XYZ
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAccMag
- tGravityAccMag
- tBodyAccJerkMag
- tBodyGyroMag
- tBodyGyroJerkMag
- fBodyAcc-XYZ

=====================================================================================
Processing of the Data is Done Using R Running the run_analysis.R Script:
Feature, activity, and subject datasets are loaded from the text files.
The train and test datasets are for each item mentioned above are merged.
Subset of the modified features dataset is considered which contains features related to the mean and standard deviaiton.
Modified feature, activity, and subject datasets are all merged to one single dataset and is arranged.
The single dataset is grouped by subject and activity, and averages of the features are calculated.
Renaming variables with descriptive names.
The tidy dataset is produced.
